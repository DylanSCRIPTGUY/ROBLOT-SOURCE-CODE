# ROBLOT-SOURCE-CODE
THE SOURCE CODE
The source code for version 1.0 of ROBLOT. A roblox chat bot meant to look like a real player.
To get the code working, make a mac app called, "ROBLOT CHAT" in all caps. After that right click and press, "show package contents".
after that, delete the contents folder and replace it with this folder.

Feel free to edit IF you give me proper credit
